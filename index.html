              My name is Brandon Dooley. I want to thank you personally for
              taking time out of your day to view this website portfolio I
              created. My hope is this will demonstrate my commercial value
              effectively and efficiently so that you feel compelled to extend
              me an offer of employment.

              My current career is with The Coeur d'Alene Window Company as a
              Class A CDL Delivery Driver. This entails several functions, but
              mainly consists of a standard route that takes me through Montana
              and Wyoming. I am married, renting a beautiful home, have a little
              fur-baby, go to church, and spend time with the family (though, no
              kids at the moment). My younger years were a little hectic, but
              nowadays I'm very much focused on pushing proactive objectives and
              keeping to my word.
            </p>

              Driving as I do now has forced me to be away from home
              consistently for the last 5 Â½ years. Mixed with the dangers
              associated with weather, traffic, and heavy machinery, I felt it
              was time to move on and pursue something more reflective of my
              intelligence. This led me to TripleTen and their Software
              Engineering program.
            </p>

            <p class="introduction__text">
              Starting October 1st, 2024, I proactively and passionately began
              to spend my free time and energy learning and working their
              boot-camp. Although I had played around with visual coding with
              Unreal Engine, this was the first that I hyper-focused on the
              physical coding lines with a clear curriculum. Not only has this
              program pushed modern objectives and methodologies, but their
              lessons also direct me into various tools to network effectively
              with real companies.

              improving. I will continue to update this site as I upgrade
              myself. May this endeavor be favorable.

                  This employment is definitely the best testament to my current
                  level of professionalism and maturity. There were a lot of
                  factors as to why this happened, but the decision to earn my
                  CDL prior and the sequence of events therein created the
                  chance of experiencing this opportunity. And despite the fact
                  that I am leaving this company, I will forever be grateful for
                  everything.
                </p>
                <p class="work__details-paragraph">
                  I started July 9th, 2019. This was less than a month after I
                  married my wonderful wife. The company CRST had sponsored my
                  CDL education, but decided to fire me when I wouldn't answer
                  the phone during my wedding. Considering how hectic their
                  program was prior, I thought it wise to take the opportunity
                  they gave me and find another company to work for. Sure
                  enough, along came The Coeur d'Alene Window Company, and I am
                  very grateful they gave me that opportunity.
                </p>
                <p class="work__details-paragraph">
                  Five and a half years allowed me several varieties of
                  challenging experiences. I was also able to travel to several
                  states and meet several interesting people. Every week it
                  seemed there was something new I was learning or doing. I was
                  also fortunate enough to train several new employees. This
                  further helped me hone my craft, better understand how to
                  troubleshoot problems, and find appropriate solutions that I
                  could explain in a way others could understand.
                </p>
                <p class="work__details-paragraph">
                  Probably the number one lesson I learned with this company is
                  the importance of communication. This particular issue created
                  many interesting and challenging circumstances. I definitely
                  had opportunities to practice troubleshooting issues, creating
                  delivery game-plans, determining routing, analyzing costs, and
                  other concerns that revolve around good common sense business
                  practices. This, too, made me much more independent and
                  proactive.

                  If someone were to look at the situation from the perspective
                  of what CDL life is typically like, I think many fellow truck
                  drivers would be envious. The pay was per hour, I would be
                  able to get hotels and food on the company dime, my schedule
                  would be typically consistent as Monday through Friday, and it
                  had a decent balance of driving and physical labor. Leaving
                  this company and this industry, though, came down to other
                  factors.
                </p>
                <p class="work__details-paragraph">
                  When looking at truck driving, advancement leads to more road
                  and less home. Truckers have to be where the loads are, and
                  that can mean needing to be anywhere at any time. And once
                  you're on the road, there's no end until the route or load is
                  finished. Weather comes in, you fight through or hunker down.
                  Truck breaks down, get have to get it fixed. You can't just
                  decide to go home; it's an entire process and requires some
                  type of sacrifice. Something big happens â like your wife
                  giving birth â there is no âdrop-of-the-hatâ response.
                  Doctor's appointments? Few and far between; if you get time.
                  Meanwhile, declining health, terrible truck stop food,
                  terrible sleep, and the only supplies you have are what you
                  bring with you and what you have access to buy.

                <p class="work__details-paragraph">
                  It was time. Time to find something different. Time to find
                  something more progressive and challenging that could also
                  afford me a much more healthy and fulfilling life. Thus,
                  TripleTen and their Software Engineering program.

                Retail work lost it's appeal, particularly since I was pushed
                into stocking shelves and had a part-time schedule. I wanted a
                more challenging environment with more potential for
                advancement. This lead me to McDonald's.
              </p>
              <p class="work__details-paragraph">
                In comparison to Staples, McDonald's was much more fast-paced.
                There were plenty of tasks that I could focus on depending on
                what position I was for the day. That was the other aspect that
                was appealing: they moved me around. They weren't afraid to let
                me learn other positions. In fact, McDonald's was on track to
                have me open the store.
              </p>
              <p class="work__details-paragraph">
                Although this experience ended in a short time-frame, it was the
                most intense and fulfilling work opportunity I had up to that
                time in my history. It was the first time I was able to see what
                it takes to actually run a business, and I still feel inspired
                to this day to start a restaurant once the finances allow it. It
                also triggered instant memorization and progressive inference,
                allowing me to act more and more quickly and accurately.

                College was an interesting time for me. Although I was pushing
                for three Bachelors, I also allowed myself to be manipulated
                through peer pressure. It made life harder on myself, part of
                which included maintaining employment with companies. But even
                so, I still tried to push myself towards success. Staples was an
                excellent example of this.
              </p>
              <p class="work__details-paragraph">
                This position was mainly cashiering. They would also have me
                help with stocking shelves and assisting customers on the floor.
                Sometimes I would help out the tech and copy departments
                depending. All in all, I would tend to float wherever I was
                needed if able. There was a time when I was considered for
                advancement; I would be the inventory manager. They had me take
                part in re-models of stores, have me practice with their
                software interfaces and processes, and all around get a taste of
                running the store.

              <p class="work__details-paragraph">
                Unfortunately, there were certain events that acted against that
                objective. These events made it where they wouldn't even have me
                as a cashier; I would just simply stock shelves. Now, there
                wasn't anything I did intentionally, but nevertheless the
                accumulation of events just made my future there ultimately
                dead. After I realized that, I searched for other work, which
                lead me to McDonald's.

                I wanted to give recognition to my first employment. This was an
                entry level position as a âCourtesy Clerk,â which entailed
                bagging groceries, assisting customers, and gathering carts. It
                was a good start. At the time, I was dual-enrolling between
                high-school and college. This allowed me some extra cash and
                experience while hitting milestones like earning my driver's
                license.

            I started the dual enrollment program in 2006 through North Idaho
            College (NIC). Other than the first semester, my classes were
            primary at the NIC campus. Originally, I was going to pursue
            Engineering through University of Idaho, which would have entailed
            transferring over the Moscow after earning my Associates. After
            evaluating costs, involving myself in stupidity as mentioned
            previously, and learning that Lewis-Clark State College (LCSC) was
            running their campus and programs right next to NIC, I decided to
            pursue Bachelors in Communications and Management. This gave me the
            option to dual enroll between NIC and LCSC, allowing me to earn a
            3.85 GPA with 18 credits during the spring of 2010. This named me to
            LCSC's Dean's List and also encouraged offers to participate with
            the Ambassador Honor's Society and the National Society of
            Leadership and Success.

          <p class="education__paragraph">
            In total throughout my educational experiences, the four degrees I
            earned were a B.A. and a B.S. in Communication Arts, B.S. in
            Management, and an A.A in General Studies. I also earned a
            Certificate of Leader and Management in the Hospitality Industry
            from the American Hotel & Lodging Educational Institute and the
            ServSafe Certification from the National Restaurant Association
            during my time with McDonald's.

                This project wasn't about design as it was more about OOP and
                importing/exporting. Further, the organization and concision
                taught many commercially-relavent practices.
