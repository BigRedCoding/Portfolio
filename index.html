          <p class="page__default-remove introduction__text">As you can see, my name is Brandon Dooley. I want to thank you personally for taking time out of your day to view this website portfolio I created. My hope is this will demonstrate my commercial value effectively and efficiently so that you feel compelled to extend me an offer of employment.</p>

          <p class="page__default-remove introduction__text">My current career is with The Coeur d'Alene Window Company as a Class A CDL Delivery Driver. This entails several functions, but mainly consists of  a standard route that takes me through Montana and Wyoming. I am married, renting a beautiful home, have a little fur-baby, go to church, and spend time with the family (though, no kids at the moment). My younger years were a little hectic, but nowadays I'm very much focused on pushing proactive objectives and keeping to my word.</p>

          <p class="page__default-remove introduction__text">Driving as I do now has forced me to be away from home consistently for the last 5 ½ years. Mixed with the dangers associated with weather, traffic, and heavy machinery, I felt it was time to move on and pursue something more reflective of my intelligence. This led me to TripleTen and their Software Engineering program.</p>

          <p class="page__default-remove introduction__text">Starting October 1st, 2024, I proactively and passionately began to spend my free time and energy learning and working their boot-camp. Although I had played around with visual coding with Unreal Engine, this was the first that I hyper-focused on the physical coding lines with a clear curriculum. Not only has this program pushed modern objectives and methodologies, but their lessons also direct me into various tools to network effectively with real companies.</p>

          <p class="page__default-remove introduction__text">Here is my a efforts accumulated and summarized, perpetually improving. I will continue to update this site as I upgrade myself. May this endeavor be favorable.</p>

                <p class="work__details-paragraph">This employment is definitely the best testament to my current level of professionalism and maturity. There were a lot of factors as to why this happened, but the decision to earn my CDL prior and the sequence of events therein created the chance of experiencing this opportunity. And despite the fact that I am leaving this company, I will forever be grateful for everything.</p>
                <p class="work__details-paragraph">I started July 9th, 2019. This was less than a month after I married my wonderful wife. The company CRST had sponsored my CDL education, but decided to fire me when I wouldn't answer the phone during my wedding. Considering how hectic their program was prior, I thought it wise to take the opportunity they gave me and find another company to work for. Sure enough, along came The Coeur d'Alene Window Company. </p>
                <p class="work__details-paragraph">Probably the number one lesson I learned with this company is the importance of communication. This particular issue has cost and continues to cost the company thousands of dollars while ultimately making my job exponentially harder considering my direct interaction with the customers. I definitely had opportunities to practice troubleshooting issues, creating delivery game-plans, determining routing, analyzing costs, and other concerns that revolve around good common sense business practices. This, too, made me much more independent and proactive.</p>

              </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="work__details-cdawindow">
                <p class="work__details-paragraph">If someone were to look at the situation from the perspective of what CDL life is typically like, I think many fellow truck drivers would be envious. The pay was per hour, I would be able to get hotels and food on the company dime, my schedule would be typically consistent and Monday through Friday, and it had a decent balance of driving and physical labor. Leaving this company and this industry, though, came down to other factors.</p>
                <p class="work__details-paragraph">When looking at truck driving, advancement leads to more road and less home. Truckers have to be where the loads are, and that can mean needing to be anywhere at any time. And once you're on the road, there's no end until the route or load is finished. Weather comes in, you fight through or hunker down. Truck breaks down, get have to get it fixed. You can't just decide to go home; it's an entire process and requires some type of sacrifice. Something big happens – like your wife giving birth –  there is no “drop-of-the-hat” response. Doctor's appointments? Few and far between; if you get time. Meanwhile, declining health, terrible truck stop food, terrible sleep, and the only supplies you have are what you bring with you and what you have access to buy. </p>
                <p class="work__details-paragraph">It was time. Time to find something different. Time to find something more progressive and challenging that could also afford me a much more healthy and fulfilling life. Thus, TripleTen and their Software Engineering program.</p>
